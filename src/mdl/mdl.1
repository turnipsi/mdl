.Sh NAME
.Nm mdl
.Nd a music description language with a MIDI sequencer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mdl
.Op Fl cnsv
.Op Fl d Ar debuglevel
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Fl m Ar MIDI-interface
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
interprets music files
and plays them through a MIDI device.
Syntax mimicks the
.Xr lilypond 1
syntax but is not compatible.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Force a client mode.
.Nm
normally connects to a server,
but if that fails then it falls back to standalone mode.
However, with
.Fl c
option
.Nm
exits with error if connecting to a server fails.
.It Fl d Ar debuglevel
Set
.Ar debuglevel
to some value.
Supported values are numbers from from 0 to 4,
where a bigger number means
more detailed debugging messages are printed.
Other possible values are
.Cm clock ,
.Cm exprconv ,
.Cm functions ,
.Cm ipc ,
.Cm joins ,
.Cm midi ,
.Cm midistream ,
.Cm mm ,
.Cm parsing ,
.Cm process ,
.Cm relative ,
.Cm seq
and
.Cm song .
Several options may be set by separating them with a comma,
for example
.Dq joins,midi .
.It Fl f Ar device
Sets the MIDI device path.
Interpretation for this depends on the MIDI-interface used.
For
.Cm raw
MIDI devices this the file path with the default value of
.Dq /dev/rmidi0 .
For
.Cm sndio
MIDI devices this is the name of the
.Xr sndio 7
MIDI device with the default value of
.Dq default .
See the
.Fl m
option for setting the MIDI-interface type.
.It Fl m Ar MIDI-interface
Set the
.Ar MIDI-Interface
type
.Nm
uses.
Possible values are
.Cm raw
and
.Cm sndio ,
but not all options may have been compiled in.
See the
.Ar -v
option for supported MIDI-interfaces
and the default MIDI-interface type used.
.It Fl n
Dry run.
Do most things except do not actually play music
or establish any server connections
(implies the
.Fl s
option).
.It Fl s
Run
.Nm
in standalone mode,
in which it does not connect to a server,
but manages interpreter and sequencer subprocesses by itself.
.It Fl v
Show
.Nm
version and the supported MIDI interfaces
.Nm
was compiled with.
.El
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Play a major scale from middle
.Ql c
to upper
.Ql c
using quarter notes:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
c4 d e f g a b c
.Ed
.Pp
Play some drumbeats, with bass drum, snare and steady hihat hits.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
<<
  { bd4            sn           bd8   bd     sd4         }
  { hh16 hh hh hh  hh hh hh hh  hh hh hh hh  hh hh hh hh }
>>
.Ed
.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" For sections 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 printf/stderr messages only.

.\" .Sh CAVEATS
.Sh BUGS
On
.Fx ,
.Nm
sometimes exits with an error for some unknown reason.
.Pp
Parser does not suggest where parsing fails or why.
.Pp
Drum handling is strange and lacking, for example drum volumes
can not be adjusted.
.Pp
Many others probably, but the most serious one is that
.Nm
is lacking features that a programming language should have,
such as variables, functions and such.
The current plan is to integrate with Tcl
that should provide some of that functionality.
