.Sh NAME
.Nm mdl
.Nd a music description language with a MIDI sequencer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mdl
.Op Fl cnsv
.Op Fl d Ar debuglevel
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Fl m Ar MIDI-interface
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
interprets music files
and plays them through a MIDI device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Force a client mode.
.Nm
normally connects to a server,
but if that fails then it falls back to standalone mode.
However, with
.Fl c
option
.Nm
exits with error if connecting to a server fails.
.It Fl d Ar debuglevel
Set
.Ar debuglevel
to some value.
Supported values are numbers from from 0 to 4,
where a bigger number means
more detailed debugging messages are printed.
Other possible values are
.Cm clock ,
.Cm exprconv ,
.Cm functions ,
.Cm ipc ,
.Cm joins ,
.Cm midi ,
.Cm midistream ,
.Cm mm ,
.Cm parsing ,
.Cm process ,
.Cm relative ,
.Cm seq
and
.Cm song .
Several options may be set by separating them with a comma,
for example
.Dq joins,midi .
.It Fl f Ar device
Sets the MIDI device path.
Interpretation for this depends on the MIDI-interface used.
For
.Cm raw
MIDI devices this the file path with the default value of
.Dq /dev/rmidi0 .
For
.Cm sndio
MIDI devices this is the name of the
.Xr sndio 7
MIDI device with the default value of
.Dq default .
See the
.Fl m
option for setting the MIDI-interface type.
.It Fl m Ar MIDI-interface
Set the
.Ar MIDI-Interface
type
.Nm
uses.
Possible values are
.Cm raw
and
.Cm sndio ,
but not all options may have been compiled in.
See the
.Ar -v
option for supported MIDI-interfaces
and the default MIDI-interface type used.
.It Fl n
Dry run.
Do most things except do not actually play music
or establish any server connections
(implies the
.Fl s
option).
.It Fl s
Run
.Nm
in standalone mode,
in which it does not connect to a server,
but manages interpreter and sequencer subprocesses by itself.
.It Fl v
Show
.Nm
version and the supported MIDI interfaces
.Nm
was compiled with.
.El
.Sh SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS
.Nm
interprets files or standard input written in the
.Nm
language.
The language describes notes (including drum hits)
that trigger midi events played by a sequencer.
Syntax and semantics are very similar to those used in the
.Xr lilypond 1
music typesetting program,
but they are not compatible.
.Pp
Notes are expressed as letters, which are:
.Ql c ,
.Ql d ,
.Ql e ,
.Ql f ,
.Ql g ,
.Ql a
and
.Ql b .
Notes can be modified to be
.Dq sharp
by appending
.Ql is ,
and also they can modified to be
.Dq flat
by appending
.Ql es .
That is,
.Ql fis
means sharp
.Ql f ,
and
.Ql aes
means flat
.Ql a .
These can be applied many times
meaning that the following equivalences are true:
.Bl -column "X" -offset indent
.It Li "cisis   = d"
.It Li "fes     = e"
.It Li "fisisis = gis"
.El
.Pp
Mixing both
.Ql es
and
.Ql is
is not allowed on the same note (XXX should this be relaxed?).
To get a flat
.Ql e
use
.Ql ees .
(XXX
.Ql es
almost works but needs a fix.)
.Pp
Note lengths are expressed with numbers that follow notes,
where number
.Ql n
means to play a note for 1/n measures.
This means that to play note
.Ql c
for 1/8 measures, one should write
.Ql c8 ,
and when
.Nm
reads
.Ql e12 ,
it interprets that to mean note
.Ql e
should be played for 1/12 measures.
.Pp
Note lengths may be extended with zero or more dots.
Each dot extends the length by
.Ql 1/(2^n) ,
where
.Ql n
is the dot count.
For example:
.Bl -column "XXXXX" "X" -offset indent
.It Li "c4"     Ta "1/4 measures"
.It Li "c4."    Ta "1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8 measures"
.It Li "c4.."   Ta "1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 = 7/16 measures"
.It Li "c4..."  Ta "1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 = 15/32 measures"
.It Li "c4...." Ta "1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 = 31/64 measures"
.El
.Pp
Previous notes affect subsequent notes
regarding their octave and length.
If there are no previous notes
or a new subexpression is defined,
the default note is used instead as reference point.
The default note is a quarter note middle
.Ql c .
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Play a major scale from middle
.Ql c
to upper
.Ql c
using quarter notes:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
c4 d e f g a b c
.Ed
.Pp
Play some drumbeats, with bass drum, snare and steady hihat hits.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
<<
  { bd4            sn           bd8   bd     sd4         }
  { hh16 hh hh hh  hh hh hh hh  hh hh hh hh  hh hh hh hh }
>>

.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" For sections 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 printf/stderr messages only.

.\" .Sh CAVEATS
.Sh BUGS
On
.Fx ,
.Nm
sometimes exits with an error for some unknown reason.
.Pp
Parser does not suggest where parsing fails or why.
.Pp
Drum handling is strange and lacking, for example drum volumes
can not be adjusted.
.Pp
Many others probably, but the most serious one is that
.Nm
is lacking features that a programming language should have,
such as variables, functions and such.
The current plan is to integrate with Tcl
that should provide some of that functionality.
