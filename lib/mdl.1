.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
interprets music files
and plays them through a midi device.
Syntax mimicks the
.Xr lilypond 1
syntax but is not compatible.
.Pp
When
.Fl d
option is specified,
.Nm
is started in server mode,
when it also listens on a UNIX-domain socket
for incoming music scripts.
Whenever a music script is received,
the music that is currently playing
is replaced by the music described by the received script.
If all files have been played,
or no files were given as command line arguments,
.Nm
continues to run waiting for more music scripts on socket.
