.Sh NAME
.Nm mdl
.Nd a music description language with a midi sequencer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mdl
.Op Fl cnsv
.Op Fl d Ar debuglevel
.Op Fl D Ar mdl-directory
.Op Fl m Ar midi-interface
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
interprets music files
and plays them through a midi device.
Syntax mimicks the
.Xr lilypond 1
syntax but is not compatible.
.Pp
When
.Fl s
option is specified,
.Nm
is started in server mode,
when it also listens on a UNIX-domain socket
for incoming music scripts.
Whenever a music script is received,
the music that is currently playing
is replaced by the music described by the received script.
If all files have been played,
or no files were given as command line arguments,
.Nm
continues to run waiting for more music scripts on socket.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Send music description to server (act as client only).
.It Fl d Ar debuglevel
Set
.Ar debuglevel
to some value.
Supported values are numbers from from 0 to 4,
where a bigger number means
more detailed debugging messages are printed.
Other possible values are
.Cm clock ,
.Cm exprconv ,
.Cm joins ,
.Cm midi ,
.Cm midistream ,
.Cm mm ,
.Cm parsing ,
.Cm process ,
.Cm relative
and
.Cm song .
Several options may be set by separating them with a comma,
for example
.Dq joins,midi .
.It Fl D Ar mdl-directory
Use
.Ar mdl-directory
as the directory to keep a listening socket.
Setting this option allows running multiple instances of
.Nm
even when
.Ar -s
option is set.
.It Fl m Ar midi-interface
Set the
.Ar midi-interface
type
.Nm
uses.
Possible values are
.Cm raw
and
.Cm sndio ,
but not all options may have been compiled in.
See
.Ar -v
for supported midi-interfaces
and the default midi-interface type used.
.It Fl n
Dry run.
Do everything else but do not actually play music.
.It Fl s
Open a listening socket to accept music descriptions (server-mode).
.It Fl v
Show
.Nm
version and the supported midi interfaces
.Nm
was compiled with.
.El
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ~/.mdl/socket -compact
.It Pa ~/.mdl
the default mdl-directory
.It Pa ~/.mdl/socket
the default listening socket path
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
